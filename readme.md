## Shaders sandbox

This is just my WebGL sandbox to play with shaders (in order not to use some heavy framework like three.js for just simple shader experiments). Just using my github to host it and download via importmaps. Maybe some day I will provide some docs on how to use it, but currently it is just my simple way to play with shaders.
